# Three-level waveguide QED

This is the Jupyter notebook for https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13136

It solves the scattering output for a single photon in an arbitrary superposition of two frequencies scattering with a single three-level Lambda atom in an arbitrary superposition of two non-degenerate ground states.
